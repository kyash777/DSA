Given an array arr[] of positive integers, find the total sum of the minimum elements of every possible subarrays.

Note: It is guaranteed that the total sum will fit within a 32-bit unsigned integer.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [3, 1, 2, 4]
Output: 17
Explanation: Subarrays are [3], [1], [2], [4], [3, 1], [1, 2], [2, 4], [3, 1, 2], [1, 2, 4], [3, 1, 2, 4]. Minimums are 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1. Sum of all these is 17.
